# TODO: Update Resume Skills Section

## Tasks
- [x] Modify HTML structure in index.html to merge Soft Skills, Technical Skills, and Programming Languages into a single "Skills" section
- [x] Update CSS in style.css to create a flex layout: Soft Skills on left (text-only), Technical + Programming on right (logos only)
- [x] Remove text labels from Technical Skills and Programming Languages items
- [x] Test the layout for responsiveness

## Notes
- Soft Skills: Keep as text list on the left
- Technical Skills & Programming Languages: Display as logos only on the right, remove <h5> text
- Ensure the section title is "Skills"
- Changes completed: Removed <h4> headers for individual skill categories, keeping only the main "Skills" title.
- Layout verified: CSS flex layout ensures soft skills (text) on left, technical skills (logos) on right in same container.
